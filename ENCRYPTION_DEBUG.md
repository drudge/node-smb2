# SMB3 Encryption Debugging Status

## Fixes Applied

### 1. NTLMv2 Authentication ✅
- Fixed domain case preservation (use original case, not uppercase)
- Fixed client workstation name (use client hostname, not server name)
- Fixed TargetInfo extraction from server challenge
- Fixed negotiateFlags handling
- Added SMB 3.0.2 dialect support

**Result**: Authentication now works successfully.

### 2. Key Derivation ✅
- Implemented proper NIST SP800-108 KDF
- Fixed label format: `"SMB2AESCCM" + 0x00`
- Fixed context format: `"ServerIn " + 0x00` (with trailing space!)
- Used 'binary' encoding to preserve null bytes
- Direction: Client uses "ServerIn " for encryption, "ServerOut " for decryption

### 3. AES-CMAC Implementation ✅
- Implemented native AES-CMAC per RFC 4493
- Removed external dependency
- Proper subkey generation with left-shift and Rb constant

### 4. Transform Header Structure ✅
```
Bytes 0-3:   Protocol ID (0xFD 'S' 'M' 'B')
Bytes 4-19:  Signature (16 bytes) - CCM auth tag
Bytes 20-35: Nonce (16 bytes, first 11 used for CCM)
Bytes 36-39: OriginalMessageSize (little-endian)
Bytes 40-41: Reserved (0x0000)
Bytes 42-43: Flags (0x0001 = Encrypted)
Bytes 44-51: SessionId (8 bytes, little-endian)
```

### 5. CCM Auth Tag as Signature ✅
- Per MS-SMB2 3.1.4.1: For AES-128-CCM, the signature field IS the authentication tag
- NOT a separately calculated AES-CMAC
- Auth tag is 16 bytes from AES-CCM encryption
- Tag is written to Transform header signature field (bytes 4-19)
- Ciphertext does NOT include auth tag

### 6. NetBIOS Header Handling ✅
- Strip NetBIOS header (4 bytes) before encryption
- Encrypt only the SMB2 message
- Add new NetBIOS header for: Transform header + encrypted message
- Structure: `NetBIOS (4) + Transform (52) + Encrypted SMB2`

### 7. SMB2 Header SessionId Zeroing ✅
- Per MS-SMB2 3.1.4.1: "client MUST set SessionId in the Transform header to the Session.SessionId and MUST set SessionId in the SMB2 header to 0"
- Zero out bytes 40-47 in SMB2 header before encryption

### 8. AAD Construction ✅
- AAD = bytes 20-51 of Transform header (32 bytes)
- Includes: Nonce + OriginalMessageSize + Reserved + Flags + SessionId
- Excludes: ProtocolId + Signature

### 9. Auto-Enable Encryption ✅
- Detect ACCESS_DENIED (0xc0000022) on TreeConnect
- Automatically enable encryption and retry
- Check ShareFlags for encryption requirement (bit 0x00000008)

## Current Issue

**Status**: Server closes connection (ECONNRESET) when receiving encrypted TreeConnect

**Symptoms**:
- Authentication succeeds ✅
- Keys derived successfully ✅
- TreeConnect without encryption fails with ACCESS_DENIED ✅ (expected)
- TreeConnect with encryption: server closes connection ❌

**Debug Output Shows**:
```
Original message length: 132 bytes (SMB2 only, NetBIOS stripped)
Transform Header: All fields correct
AAD: 32 bytes, correctly extracted
CCM Nonce: 11 bytes (from 16-byte nonce field)
Encryption key: Derived with "ServerIn " context
Auth tag: 16 bytes from AES-CCM
Final packet: NetBIOS + Transform + Ciphertext
```

## What to Check Next

### Option 1: Packet Capture
Use Wireshark on Windows Server to capture encrypted SMB3 traffic from a working client (e.g., Windows Explorer). Compare byte-by-byte with our packets.

Filter: `smb2`
Look for: Transform headers (Protocol ID 0xFD534D42)

### Option 2: Server Logs
Check Windows Event Viewer:
- Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → SMBServer
- Look for encryption-related errors
- Event IDs related to encryption: 1009, 1010, 1024

### Option 3: Test Against Different Server
Try against:
- Samba server with SMB3 encryption enabled
- Different Windows Server version
- Azure Files with SMB3

### Option 4: Simplify Test
Create minimal encrypted message:
- Just NEGOTIATE + SESSION_SETUP + TREE_CONNECT
- Capture each step
- Compare with working client

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Protocol ID in Transform header: 0xFD534D42
- [x] Signature field initially zero, replaced with CCM auth tag
- [x] Nonce is 16 random bytes
- [x] OriginalMessageSize matches SMB2 message length
- [x] Reserved field is 0x0000
- [x] Flags field is 0x0001
- [x] SessionId in Transform header matches session
- [x] SessionId in SMB2 header is zeroed (all zeros)
- [x] AAD is bytes 20-51 of Transform header
- [x] CCM nonce is first 11 bytes of 16-byte nonce
- [x] Encryption key derived with "ServerIn " context
- [x] Auth tag is 16 bytes
- [x] Ciphertext length = OriginalMessageSize
- [x] NetBIOS header precedes Transform header
- [ ] ??? Unknown issue causing server rejection
