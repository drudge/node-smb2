# Next Steps for SMB3 Encryption Debugging

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **NTLMv2 Authentication** - Fully functional
2. **SMB 3.0.2 Negotiation** - Successfully negotiates dialect 0x0302
3. **Key Derivation** - All encryption keys derive correctly
4. **Transform Header Structure** - All 52 bytes match MS-SMB2 spec
5. **NetBIOS Handling** - Correctly stripped before encryption
6. **SessionId** - Correctly encoded in Transform header (verified in Wireshark)
7. **SMB2 SessionId Zeroing** - SMB2 header SessionId zeroed as required
8. **AES-128-CCM** - Implementation matches RFC 3610
9. **Auth Tag** - Using CCM auth tag as signature (correct for SMB 3.0.2)

### ❌ Current Issue
**Server closes connection (ECONNRESET) when receiving encrypted TreeConnect**

Per Wireshark:
- Packet structure recognized as "Encrypted SMB3" ✓
- Transform header parsed successfully ✓
- Server immediately sends TCP RST (connection reset) ❌

## What We've Verified

### Packet Structure (from Wireshark)
```
Transform Header (52 bytes):
  Protocol ID: fd534d42 ✓
  Signature: [16-byte CCM auth tag] ✓
  Nonce: [16 bytes, using first 11 for CCM] ✓
  OriginalMessageSize: 132 ✓
  Reserved: 0000 ✓
  Flags: 0x0001 (Encrypted) ✓
  SessionId: 61 00 00 68 00 0c 00 00 ✓ (8 bytes, correct)

SMB2 Header inside encrypted payload:
  SessionId: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ✓ (zeroed as required)
```

### Cipher Configuration
- SMB 3.0.2 uses AES-128-CCM by default ✓
- We're using AES-128-CCM ✓
- Key derivation label: "SMB2AESCCM\0" ✓
- Context: "ServerIn \0" (with space) ✓
- Nonce: 11 bytes (correct for CCM) ✓
- Auth tag: 16 bytes ✓

## Possible Causes

### 1. Signing vs Encryption Confusion
The Negotiate Response showed:
```
Security mode: 0x03, Signing enabled, Signing required
Capabilities: 0x00000007 (NO encryption bit set!)
```

**Theory**: Maybe SMB 3.0.2 doesn't advertise encryption in capabilities, but the share still requires it. The server might be expecting signed messages instead of/in addition to encrypted messages?

### 2. Missing Preauth Integrity
SMB 3.1.1 added preauth integrity hash. Maybe SMB 3.0.2 has a similar mechanism we're missing?

### 3. Wrong Direction for Keys
We use "ServerIn " for encryption (client→server). This should be correct, but worth double-checking with packet capture.

### 4. Subtle Byte Order Issue
All our byte orders appear correct, but there might be something subtle.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Packet Capture Comparison (BEST)
1. On Windows Server, run PowerShell as Admin:
   ```powershell
   # Connect locally with encryption
   New-PSDrive -Name Z -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\127.0.0.1\EncryptedShare" -Credential (Get-Credential)
   Get-ChildItem Z:\
   ```

2. Capture this in Wireshark (filter: `tcp.port == 445`)

3. Save the working encrypted TreeConnect packet

4. Compare byte-by-byte with our packet:
   - Transform header fields
   - Encrypted payload
   - Overall structure

5. Look for ANY differences

### Option 2: Try Different Server
Test against:
- **Samba with SMB3 encryption**: `smb encrypt = required` in smb.conf
- Older Windows Server (2016/2019)
- Azure Files with SMB3

### Option 3: Implement SMB 3.1.1
SMB 3.1.1 has better encryption support but requires:
- Negotiate Contexts (list of capabilities/ciphers)
- Preauth Integrity (SHA-512 hash chain)
- More complex negotiation

This is significant work but might be necessary for Windows Server 2025.

### Option 4: Check for Known Issues
Search for:
- "SMB3 encryption Node.js"
- "AES-CCM SMB3 Windows Server"
- "Transform header rejected"
- GitHub issues in similar projects (node-smb2, smbclient, etc.)

## Files to Review

### Key Implementation Files
- `src/protocol/smb3/crypto.ts` - AES-CCM encryption
- `src/protocol/smb3/TransformHeader.ts` - Transform header structure
- `src/client/Client.ts` - Encryption/decryption in send/receive
- `src/client/Session.ts` - Key derivation and encryption enabling

### Test & Debug Files
- `tests/encryption-test.ts` - Full test suite
- `tests/test-ccm.ts` - CCM implementation validation
- `ENCRYPTION_DEBUG.md` - Complete debugging guide
- `WINDOWS_DEBUG_STEPS.md` - Server-side debugging

## Test Commands

```bash
# Full test suite with debug output
npm run test:encryption

# Quick test
npm run test:quick

# CCM implementation validation
node tests/test-ccm.ts
```

## Success Criteria

When encryption works, you should see:
```
✅ Authenticated successfully
✅ TreeConnect with encryption succeeds
✅ File operations work on encrypted share
No ECONNRESET errors
```

## Contact

If you solve this, please:
1. Document the fix
2. Update ENCRYPTION_DEBUG.md
3. Create a PR with the solution
4. Help others hitting the same issue!

The authentication and crypto primitives are solid. It's something subtle about the SMB3 protocol that we're missing.
